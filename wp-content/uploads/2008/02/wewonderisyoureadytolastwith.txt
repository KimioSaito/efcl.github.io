We wonder is you ready to last with
the arms up now will you may to see
Come again
Anyone can last with
So concerns on your feet Oa-a-a
And "vicka" your hips O-la-la-la
Do as we Until this melody
Dance with us Clap your hands
Listen and learn Don't miss the chance
We're here now The Caramelldansen
It becomes a sensation "overallt" of course on	
parties comes everyone to release loose
come again
Now, we take the stages about again
So concerns on your feet
And "vicka" your hips
Do as we Until this melody
So　「だ」
came　「か」
and　「ら！」
Dance with us Clap your hands
Do like we do Take some steps to the left
Listen and learn Don't miss the chance
We're here now The Caramelldansen
